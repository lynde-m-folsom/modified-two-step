# Relative value learning

Authors: Sam Zorowitz, Sean Allan, Neil Garrett

A science fiction-themed implementation of the relative value learning task ([Palminteri et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms9096)). Runs two blocks of only counterfactual learning but can be easily adapted to include factual learning. Developed for online environments (approx. 15-20 minute administration time).
